            <h2>Ranch Horse Nutrition</h2>
                   <p>Proper health care and nutrition of the ranch horse is vitally important. Whether considering a working ranch horse,
                    evaluating horses for potential purchase, raising prospects or
                    ranch horses for resale, they all must be healthy.</p>
                   <p>Forage should be the foundation of any horse’s
                    diet. Feeding good quality hay or providing access
                    to pasture with adequate amounts of grass will help
                    reduce, or possibly eliminate, the need for
                    additional feed supplementation. On average,
                    horses should be consuming 1.5 – 2% of their body
                    weight in forage every day (about 18 – 25 pounds).</p>
                    <p>If a horse is not able to maintain its body
                        condition, or if it is being used regularly for working
                        cattle, it will likely need some additional calories
                        from grain.</p>
