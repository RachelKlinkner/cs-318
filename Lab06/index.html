        <h2>Importance of Ranch Horses</h2>
               <p>Horses help move cattle from one pasture to another or gather cows and calves from grazing lands. Before it snows, ranch hands use their horses to comb the backcountry, collecting cattle over several days. Horses allow ranchers to cover great distances and undeveloped terrains that often have no roads.</p>
               <p>Horses assist ranchers to direct cattle traffic. Ranch hands position horses and riders around the herd on a cattle drive. One or two might lead the herd, a few others flank it and the rest push from behind. The horses pay attention and are ready to redirect a stray calf or turn the herd left or right. If a bull is tagging along, horses, and most riders, have the sense to simply let him follow the herd. A good ranch horse will sense movement from the herd, displaying intelligence and boldness on a cattle drive.</p>
